# Strategy Design Pattern

## Overview
The **Strategy Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows selecting an algorithm at runtime from a set of interchangeable strategies. It enables code flexibility, promotes the **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** and **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, and helps in avoiding conditional logic.

## Use Case: Payment Processing System
We implement the **Strategy Pattern** to handle multiple payment methods in an **e-commerce system**. Instead of hardcoding logic for each payment method, we create separate strategy classes for **Credit Card, and PayPal payments**. Each payment method encapsulates its own behavior, and the context class dynamically switches between them.

### **How It Works**
- We define a **PaymentStrategy interface** that standardizes the `pay(amount)` method.
- Each payment method (Credit Card, PayPal) implements this interface in its own class.
- The **PaymentContext class** holds a reference to a `PaymentStrategy` and delegates payment execution.
- The client code (main application) initializes the context with a strategy and can switch strategies dynamically.

â”‚
â”‚â”€â”€ /context                     # Manages payment execution
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ payment_context.py       # Context class for strategy pattern
â”‚
â”‚â”€â”€ main.py                      # Entry point to test the strategy pattern

## **How It Meets SOLID Principles**
### **1. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**
- New payment methods can be added **without modifying existing code**.
- The `PaymentContext` class interacts with `PaymentStrategy` without knowing implementation details.

### **2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Each payment method class **only handles its own payment logic**.
- `PaymentContext` is **only responsible for selecting and executing a strategy**.

## **Key Benefits**
âœ” **Encapsulates behavior**: Different payment methods are implemented separately.
âœ” **Increases flexibility**: The algorithm (payment method) can be changed dynamically.
âœ” **Reduces conditional logic**: Eliminates the need for `if-else` statements for payment selection.
âœ” **Enhances maintainability**: Modifications in one strategy class do not affect others.

## When to Use the Strategy Pattern
- When you need **multiple interchangeable behaviors or algorithms**.
- When you want to **avoid complex conditional logic** (`if-elif-else`).
- When the **algorithm might change dynamically** at runtime.

ðŸš€ **The Strategy Pattern ensures clean, modular, and extensible code!**
